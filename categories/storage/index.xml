      <description><![CDATA[Introduction: These are just some random things that I would love to see implemented by Nimble Storage in their solution. I don’t actually expect most of this stuff to happen in a year, but it would be interesting to see how many do. Some are more realistic than others of course, but part of the fun in this is asking for some stuff that perhaps is a bit of a stretch.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Deduplication and backup kind of go hand in hand, so we couldn’t evaluate backup storage and not check out this segment. We had two primary goals for a deduplication appliance.
Reduce racks space while enabling us to store more data. As you know in part 1, we had a lot of rack space being consumed. While we weren’t hurting for rack space in our primary DC, we were in our DR DC.]]></description>

      <title>Backup Storage Part 2: What we wanted</title>

      <description><![CDATA[In part 1, I went over our legacy backup storage solution, and why it needed to change. This section, I’m going to outline what we were looking for in our next storage refresh.
Also, just to give you a little more context, while evaluating storage, were also looking at new backup solutions. CommVault, Veeam, EMC (Avamar and Networker), NetVault, Microsoft DPM, and a handful of cloud solutions. Point being, there were a lot of moving parts and a lot of things to consider.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Introduction: This is going to be a multi-part series where I walk you through the whole process we took in evaluating, implementing and living with a new backup storage solution. While its not a perfect solution, given the parameters we had to work within, I think we ended up with some very decent storage.
Backup Storage Part 1: The “Why” it needed to change Last year my team and I began a project to overhaul our backup solution and part of that solution involved researching some new storage options.]]></description>
