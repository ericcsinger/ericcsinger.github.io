<p>Backup and recovery is a rather dry topic, but it‚Äôs an important one. After all, what‚Äôs more critical to your company than their data? You can have the best products in the world, but if disaster strikes and you don‚Äôt have a good solution in place, it can make your recovery painful or even impossible. Still, many companies shirk investment in this segment. The good solutions (like the one I‚Äôm about to discuss) cost a pretty penny, and that‚Äôs capital that needs to be balanced with technology that makes or saves your company money. Still, insurance (and that‚Äôs what backup is) is something that‚Äôs typically on the back of companies minds.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Problem Solving: Chasing SQL&#39;s Dump</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-problem" data-numberify>The Problem:<a class="anchor ms-1" href="#the-problem"></a></h1>
<p>For years as an admin I‚Äôve had to deal with SQL. At a former employer, our SQL environment / databases were small, and backup licensing was based on agents, not capacity. Fast forward to my current employer, we have a fairly decent sized SQL environment (60 ‚Äì 70 servers), our backup‚Äôs are large , licensing is based on capacity, and we have a full time DBA crew that manage their own backup schedules, and prefer that backup‚Äôs are managed by them. What that means is dealing with a ton of dumps. Read into that as you want üôÇ</p>]]></description>

      <title>Review: 1.5 years with Veeam</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="disclaimer" data-numberify>Disclaimer:<a class="anchor ms-1" href="#disclaimer"></a></h1>
<p>These are my opinions, these are <strong>not</strong> facts. Take them with a grain of salt, and use your own judgement. These are also my personal views, not those of my employer.</p>
<p>Also, no one is paying me for this, no one asked me to write this. It‚Äôs not un-biased, but its also not a hired review.</p>

<h1 id="introduction" data-numberify>Introduction:<a class="anchor ms-1" href="#introduction"></a></h1>
<p>As you may know from reading my backup storage series, we were going from a backup migration of native CommVault to Veeam + CommVault. I wanted to put together my experience living with Veeam as an almost complete backup solution replacement for the last year and half. Again, I‚Äôm always looking for this type of stuff, but its always hard to find.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Backup Storage Part 3a: Deduplication Targets</title>
      <link>https://ericcsinger.com/backup-storage-part-3a-deduplication-targets/</link>

      <guid>https://ericcsinger.com/backup-storage-part-3a-deduplication-targets/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Deduplication and backup kind of go hand in hand, so we couldn‚Äôt evaluate backup storage and not check out this segment. We had two primary goals for a deduplication appliance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce racks space while enabling us to store more data. As you know in part 1, we had a lot of rack space being consumed. While we weren‚Äôt hurting for rack space in our primary DC, we were in our DR DC.</li>
<li>We were hoping that something like a deduplication target would finally enable us to get rid of tape and replicate our data to our DR site (instead of sneakernet).</li>
</ol>
<p>For those of you not particularly versed in deduplicated storage, there are a few things to keep in mind.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Backup Storage Part 2: What we wanted</title>
      <link>https://ericcsinger.com/backup-storage-part-2-what-we-wanted/</link>

      <guid>https://ericcsinger.com/backup-storage-part-2-what-we-wanted/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>In part 1, I went over our legacy backup storage solution, and why it needed to change. This section, I‚Äôm going to outline what we were looking for in our next storage refresh.</p>
<p>Also, just to give you a little more context, while evaluating storage, were also looking at new backup solutions. CommVault, Veeam, EMC (Avamar and Networker), NetVault, Microsoft DPM, and a handful of cloud solutions. Point being, there were a lot of moving parts and a lot of things to consider. I‚Äôll dive more into this in the coming sections, but wanted to let you know it was more than just a simple storage refresh.</p>]]></description>

<p>This is going to be a multi-part series where I walk you through the whole process we took in evaluating, implementing and living with a new backup storage solution. While its not a perfect solution, given the parameters we had to work within, I think we ended up with some very decent storage.</p>

<h1 id="backup-storage-part-1-the-why-it-needed-to-change" data-numberify>Backup Storage Part 1: The ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù it needed to change<a class="anchor ms-1" href="#backup-storage-part-1-the-why-it-needed-to-change"></a></h1>
<p>Last year my team and I began a project to overhaul our backup solution and part of that solution involved researching some new storage options. At the time, we ran what most folks would on a budget, which is simply a server, with some local DAS. It was a Dell 2900 (IIRC) with 6 MD1000‚Äôs and 1 MD1200. The solution was originally designed to manage about 10TB of data, and really was never expected to handle what ultimately ended up being much greater than that. The solution was less than ideal for a lot of reasons that I‚Äôm sharing below.</p>]]></description>
