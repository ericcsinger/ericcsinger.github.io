      <description>Version: 1.0.0
Series Introduction Whether you&amp;rsquo;re new to ARM/Bicep or a pro, I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve run into the issue of needing conditional properties. Unfortunately, ARM and Bicep do not officially have functions built in to handle this natively. At least not as of yet. I was surprised when writing this, to not see a whole lot of articles showing how work around this.
In this series, I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you a few ways you can work a round this.</description>

      <description>Version: 1.0.0
Introduction As many know, I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of automation. A lot of my blog posts have focused on leveraging PowerShell to do my bidding. As my career has evolved, so have the tools I leverage. In a cloud world, even scripting by itself can become to error prone and inconsistent. Many have been leveraging IaC (Infrastructure as Code) to solve this problem. I am one such person. For years I&amp;rsquo;ve had an on again / off again relationship with Azure ARM.</description>

      <description>Version: 1.0.1
Introduction Look we all know the running joke is &amp;ldquo;Microsoft Security&amp;rdquo; is an oxymoron. Over the years though, Microsoft has made large strides in improving security. In fact, one could make a case that they have defined newer standards that others have lacked.
That said, I&amp;rsquo;d like to discuss an area that has left companies exposed for malicious intent. Monitoring in a Microsoft Windows environment.
Finally, before continuing. These are my opinions shaped from my own experience.</description>

      <description>PowerShell: Find orphaned disks in Azure and their cost Version: 1.0.1
Introduction: Just wanted to get something super simple out there. I was curious how many unattatched disks our Azure portal had and what it was costing us. This little script will give us the basic answer to that question.
The script This will loop through all subscriptions and gather all disks with a status of &amp;ldquo;unattatched&amp;rdquo;. Then it will try to find out how much they cost.</description>

      <description>PowerShell: Remove a failed domain controller Version: 1.0.1
Introduction: Let&amp;rsquo;s face it, removing a domain controller via the GUI is easy, but sometimes you just want to know how to automate something. In my research there was a lot of resources on how to cleanup using the GUI, or via NTDS. Nothing about utilizing PowerShell.
Parameters Let&amp;rsquo;s start by estalishing some parameters
#Array to hold roles of original DC $All_Roles_To_Move = New-Object -TypeName &amp;#34;System.</description>

      <description>RDP: An internal error has occurred Problem overview One of my colleagues hit me up about an issue they were seeing when trying to RDP into a DC. The error from RDP was &amp;ldquo;An internal error has occurred&amp;rdquo;. Totally useful right :-).
We could console in so that was a slight sigh of relief.
Other symptoms When I consoled into the system and look at the event logs, the following event entry was created after each RDP attempt.</description>

      <description>Azure, PowerShell jobs, and hash tables Introduction One of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned in administering Azure, is singular tasks can take a long time. When using the web GUI, it&amp;rsquo;s not a big deal. Start a new tab, while the task runs in the background.
What do you do when you&amp;rsquo;re in PowerShell? Something as simple as shutting down a VM, can sometimes take 5 - 15 minutes. Your console is locked during that time.</description>

      <description>Moved to GitHub pages Sorry for the abrupt change for anyone out there following my blog. I forgot about my hosting contract expiring with BlueHost. Not wanting to shell out for another year on their platform. I accelerated my migration to GitHub Pages.
I wanted my content to be in a portable format, the best one being markdown. I also didn&amp;rsquo;t want the hassle of maintaining a full on custom website, so GitHub Pages is great solution for me.</description>

      <description>We migrated to Office 365 last year and were are in the process of cleaning up some items left behind. One of the many things weâve needed to clean up is stale activesync devices. I wanted to share a very simplified example of the code I used to delete the container in case it helps anyone in the future.

      <description>This is the initial release of my WSUS module. This is a module I put together to properly organize a lot of my one off WSUS functions.
I have found these functions useful for reporting n the status of computers in WSUS in mass. Querying the DB directly, while not recommended, is much faster than using the API, and you can get a lot more information out of it.

Theyâre all IT celebrities in my books, and I failed to even scratch the surface of all the folks Iâm following / interact with.

      <description>Sorry itâs been so long since Iâve wrote anything. Iâve been busy with life and working on a new Powershell module. Iâm hoping to get back into the groove soon. Iâve been working on a few things at work that might be interesting to write about.
For now, Iâll leave you with this. Iâve released my 1.0.0 version of my WSUS Powershell module. Iâm not considering it âofficiallyâ released until I can start writing the wiki on how to use the module, but it is on the Powershell gallery and it is on my Github.</description>

      <title>PSA: VM Backup hot add mode with Nimble NOS 5.x on vVOLs</title>

      <description>Just a quick pubic service announcement. If youâre on Nimble NOS 5.x and you use vVOLâs and youâre backing up VMâs with a vendor that uses the VDDK APIâs, you might want to confirm your VMâs are in fact using hot add mode.
We discovered by happen stance, that after upgrading our Nimble SAN from 4.x to 5.x, that any VM that was on a vVOL on that particular NOS version started failing to attach disks during a backup.</description>

      <description>I know I havenât been posting a lot, but thatâs because Iâve been busy developing my first public Powershell modules. This short post isnât to discuss the specifics of that, but rather my new strategy going forward.
Many of you probably know what GitHub is by now, but for those of you who donât, itâs pretty much the most popular version control system for code. While Iâm not a developer per se, I do have a lot of Powershell stuff I write, and I wanted to start getting more formal with how I organize and manage it.</description>

      <guid>https://ericcsinger.com/problem-solving-vmware-vm-not-reading-vmdk-serial-number-in-os/</guid>
      <description>I created a function while ago that utilizes the VMDK serial number to map which VMDK is used for a Windows volume. Starting with Windows 10 / Server 2016, I noticed that I could no longer see the serial number of a VMDK insides the OS. After reaching out to VMware, turned out to be a really simple fix.
First let me share the relevant KB:
https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/52815 I would suggest you make sure this setting is present on all VMâs.</description>

      <description>In general, I find DRS does a fantastic job of keeping VMâs happy. However, in the past, Iâve seen a number of unexplained situations where hosts in a cluster run out of memory when a VM goes from idle, to busy all of a sudden. In fact, this happened three times to us in a dedicated cluster for our SQL VMâs. What was unexplained wasnât how the host ran out of memory, that was pretty easy to track down.</description>

      <description>Introduction: We setup a decent number of SQL servers every year. Most of the time weâre migrating to a newer OS + SQL combo, but sometimes itâs for a new product. As you may have read in my virtualizing SQL post, one of the pros to virtualizing SQL, was having this ability. Having seen the ameba affect virtualization created for other systems, I knew this would soon happen with SQL as well.</description>

      <guid>https://ericcsinger.com/review-5-years-virtualizing-microsoft-sql-server/</guid>
      <description>Introduction: I know what youâre thinking, itâs 2017, why are you writing about virtualizing Microsoft SQL? Most are doing it after all. And even if theyâre not, thereâs this whole SQLaaS thing thatâs starting to take off, so why would anyone care? Well Iâm writing this as more of a reflection on virtualizing SQL. What works well, what doesnât, what lessons Iâve learned, what Iâm still learning, etc.
Like most things on the internet, I find that folks tend to share all the good, without sharing any of the bad (or vice versa).</description>

      <description>I know Iâm totally guilty of saying expletives with regards to truckers. Being honest, most of it is due to my own impatience / selfishness. Still once I realize, that Iâm getting upset about a person thatâs driving a 40-ton vehicle cautiously, things tend to fall back into perspective. In fact, the more Iâve watched shows like Ice Road Truckers, and various documentaries about truckâin, the more I find that thereâs just not enough gratitude expressed for these folks.</description>

      <description>Series Introduction: Back in October I had a grand plan to have 23 days of thanks. Unfortunately, life got in the way, and I never had the time to pre-write all the posts I wanted to. Rather than giving up, Iâm going to punch out as many as I can before the 24th. Since I want to focus on the month of thanks, by giving thanks, Iâm not going to be writing any technical posts.</description>

      <title>Powershell Scripting: Get-ECSWSUSComputerUpdatesStatusReport</title>
      <link>https://ericcsinger.com/powershell-scripting-get-ecswsuscomputerupdatesstatusreport/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 07 Oct 2017 20:38:40 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://ericcsinger.com/powershell-scripting-get-ecswsuscomputerupdatesstatusreport/</guid>
      <description>Introduction: I hate the WSUS reports built into the console. Theyâre slow, and when it comes to doing something useful with the data, itâs basically impossible. Thatâs why I wrote this function.
I wanted an ability to gather data on a given WSUS computer(s), and work with it in Powershell. This function gives me the ability to write scripts for bulk reports, automate my patching process (checking that all updates are done), and in general, gives me the same data the standard WSUS report does, but at a MUCH faster rate.</description>

      <guid>https://ericcsinger.com/powershell-scripting-get-ecswsuscomputer-and-get-ecswsuscomputersintargetgroup/</guid>
      <description>Introduction: These two functions by themselves arenât exactly sexy. Their main goal is to be used to feed my function Get-ECSWSUSComputerUpdatesStatusReport. Still, I can see some limited value to them outside of that use case.
One thing youâll notice, is iâm hitting SQL directly instead of querying the WSUS APIs. Iâm doing this, despite it not being recommended, because itâs infinitely faster and far more flexible that the APIs.
Dependencies: First and foremost, you need my Invoke-ECSSQLQuery function located here .</description>

      <description>Introduction: This post is 100% off topic, itâs about my âexotic carâ experience through 877stockcar.com. In general, my blog is for tech stuff, but I figure it might be fun to write about something non-tech for once.

      <description>Introduction: If you donât know by now, Iâm a huge PowerShell fan. Itâs my go to scripting language for anything related to Microsoft (and non-Microsoft) automation and administration. So when it came time to automating post exchange cumulative update setting, I was a bit surprised to see some of the code examples from Microsoft, not containing any PowerShell example. Surprised is probably the wrong word, how about annoyed? I mean, after all, this is not only the company that shoved this awesome scripting language down our throat, but also the very team that was the first one to have a comprehensive set of admin abilities via PowerShell.</description>

      <description>Introduction: If you remember a little bit ago, I said I was trying to work around the lack of driver management with vendors. This function is the start of a few tools you can use to potentially make your life a little easier.
VMwareâs drivers are VIBS (but not all VIBS are drivers). So the key to knowing if you have the correct drivers is to find which VIB matches which PCI device.</description>

      <description>Hi Folks,
After updating WSUS to support Windows 10 newer update format, we noticed that our Windows 10 client werenât working. The error they were getting was 8024401c whenever we checked for updates (post WSUS upgrade). Initially we thought it was related to the WSUS upgrade, but found out that most of our systems hadnât been updating for a while. So we moved on to troubleshooting the client further. We found that the following GPO âDo not connect to any Windows Update Internet locationsâ was not configured.</description>

      <description>Introduction: Backup and recovery is a rather dry topic, but itâs an important one. After all, whatâs more critical to your company than their data? You can have the best products in the world, but if disaster strikes and you donât have a good solution in place, it can make your recovery painful or even impossible. Still, many companies shirk investment in this segment. The good solutions (like the one Iâm about to discuss) cost a pretty penny, and thatâs capital that needs to be balanced with technology that makes or saves your company money.</description>

      <guid>https://ericcsinger.com/thinking-out-loud-why-do-server-vendors-still-struggle-with-driver-and-firmware-management/</guid>
      <description>History: Let me give you a little back story before digging into the meat of this post. My team and I make a very concerted effort to keep our servers firmware and drivers updated. Weâve gone so far as to purchase software from Dell, implement a process on how firmware / drivers are to be updated, and ensuring that its routinely done every quarter. We do this because in general itâs a best practice, but also because weâve run into too many occasions where troubleshooting with a vendor stops (if it ever starts) very quickly if the drivers / firmware isnât recent.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: These are opinions, not facts and these opinions are mine, not my employers.
Introduction: Upon receiving the news that HP was to acquire Nimble, I canât say I was exactly thrilled. Nothing personal against HP, they make great servers, but I like Nimble the way it is right now. None the less, I know the industry is moving in a direction where its either get big, or get out. There is a huge storm âcloudâ looming, and if youâre an on premises solution, its going to be a scary time in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Naming Conventions: Server Names</title>

      <guid>https://ericcsinger.com/naming-conventions-server-names/</guid>
      <description>Introduction: One of the things Iâm struggling with, is how to balance the number of posts per naming convention. It would be easy in some ways to use a single post per server type, but it would also be overly redundant in many ways. I originally wrote a dedicated post to SQL server naming conventions, and realized that the logic behind its name is ultimately a similar logic for other server names.</description>

      <description>Introduction: I wrote a really quick review here about MVP systems JAMS product about 1 year or so ago (maybe a little less). At the time, I was in search of a solution that could help me glue together several disjointed systems in a workflow. Specifically, we were trying to integrate Veeam and CommVault backupâs together. Veeam was of course doing the VM backupâs, and CommVault was copying the Veeam files to tape.</description>

      <title>Naming Conventions: SQL Server Names</title>

      <guid>https://ericcsinger.com/naming-conventions-sql-server-names/</guid>
      <description>Introduction: If youâre working in a Windows environment like me, you have to deal with 15 character limitations (at least if you care about NETBIOS resolution). Honestly, really cramps my style, but these conventions were written with that limitation in mind. If youâre using this for a Linux based server running MySQL or PostgreSQL, you might be able to get a little more detailed.
Multi Environment / Cluster or standalone: At my employer ASI, we have to contend with multiple applications, multiple environments for each application and in a lot of cases clusters.</description>

      <description>Introduction: One thing that always kind of sucked with windows servers (and its even worse with Linux) is dealing with how to manage local administrator rights. Now I realize a lot of you just add yourself to the domain admins and use that account (not a security best practices) to administer your servers, but what about everyone and everything else that might need local admin access? What I have for you here is how I not only created a new naming conventions, but also how I tackled managing local administrator access in windows domain environment.</description>

      <description>Introduction: If there was one area in IT that I tend to be fanatical about (some would say fanatical isnât a strong enough word), I would have to say its naming conventions. For me, learning about naming conventions in school and then seeing it put into practice in my first real gig, really enforced the concept that naming conventions are important. I actually consider myself pretty lucky in that respect because I donât think a lot of people have had the fortune of studying about the concept, let alone working for a company that had a decent naming convention.</description>

      <description>Introduction: If youâre not in a DevOps based shop, or living under a rock, you may not know that Microsoft has been working on a solution that by all accounts sounds like its poised to usurp GPO / GPP. The solution Iâm talking about is Desired State Configuration, or DSC. According to all the marketing hype, DSC is the next best thing for IT since virtualization. If the vision comes to fruition, GPO and GPP will be a legacy solution.</description>

      <description>Disclaimer: Typical stuff, these are my views not my employers, theyâre opinions not facts (mostly at least), use your own best judgement, take my views with a quarry full of salt.
Introduction: When I started at my current employer, one of the things I wasnât super keen on was having to deal with Dell hardware. I had some previous experience with Dell servers, none of which was good. My former employer was an HP shop that had converted from Dell, and early on in my SysAdmin gig, I had the misfortune of having to work with some of the older Dell servers (r850 as an example).</description>

      <description>Introduction: In general, Iâm not a huge fan of hyper converged infrastructure. To me, its more âhypeâ than substance at the moment. It was born out of web scale infrastructure like Google, Facebook, etc. and IMO, that is still the area where itâs better suited. The only enterprise layer where I see HCI being a good fit is VDI, other than that, almost every other enterprise workload would be better suited on new school shared storage.</description>

      <description>Introduction: These are just some random things that I would love to see implemented by Nimble Storage in their solution. I donât actually expect most of this stuff to happen in a year, but it would be interesting to see how many do. Some are more realistic than others of course, but part of the fun in this is asking for some stuff that perhaps is a bit of a stretch.</description>

      <description>Introduction: I hate dealing with tapes, pretty much every aspect of them. The tracking of them is a PITA, having to physically manage them is a PITA, dealing with tape library issues is a PITA, dealing with tape encryption is a PITA, running out of tapes is a PITA, dealing with legal hold for tapes is a PITA, and I could keep going on with the many ways that tape just sucks.</description>

      <description>Sometimes the WSUS console, just doesnât give you the info you need, or it doesnât provide it in a format you want. This query is for one of those examples. This query can be used in multiple ways to show the update status of a computer, computers or computer in a computer target. For me, I wanted to see the update status, without worrying about what non-applicable updates were installed. I also, didnât care about updates that I didnât approve, which was another reason I wrote this query.</description>

      <description>This is a simple query you can use map your computers to their various targets in a nice easy to export table. Iâd love to say the script is sexier than that, but its really not. You can find the sql query here .
There is only one section worth mentioning because it can change the way a computer is mapped to a computer target.
By default, my query returns the computer target location based on the child object.</description>

      <description>Quick Powershell post for those of you that may on occasion want to retrieve data out of a SQL table via Powershell. I didnât personally do most of the heavy lifting in this, I simply took some work that various folks out there did and put it into a repeatable function instead.
Firstly, head over to here to my GitHub if you want to grab it. Iâll be keeping it updated as change requests come in, or as I get new ideas, so make sure if you do use my function, that you check back in on occasion for new versions.</description>

I was the first one to comment, and maybe its just a coincidence, but it seems like I got a small fire started. If you have any strong feeling either way, maybe its worth posting your view in their comments or mine.

      <description>The Problem: For years as an admin Iâve had to deal with SQL. At a former employer, our SQL environment / databases were small, and backup licensing was based on agents, not capacity. Fast forward to my current employer, we have a fairly decent sized SQL environment (60 â 70 servers), our backupâs are large , licensing is based on capacity, and we have a full time DBA crew that manage their own backup schedules, and prefer that backupâs are managed by them.</description>

      <description>In general I have to say Iâm not a fan of VARâs for many reasons. Most of which because I find little âValue Addâ in having them resell technology that would probably be cheaper if I wasnât stuck going through them. However, thereâs always an exception to the rule, and after a recent mess up I wanted throw a shout out to WCT for helping us out of a tough bind.</description>

      <description>I was scanning through my LinkedIn feed the other day and stumbled across an interesting picture / chart showing common mistakes that interview candidates make posted by a former colleague. To basically summarize, it was a culmination of physical characteristics (slouching, not smiling, clothing not too trendy, but not too outdated, etc.), knowing a lot about the company and position, and various other common doâs and donâts.
My first reaction was âno duhâ, but then I paused for a moment and said to myself âWhy?</description>

Also, no one is paying me for this, no one asked me to write this. Itâs not un-biased, but its also not a hired review.
Introduction: As you may know from reading my backup storage series, we were going from a backup migration of native CommVault to Veeam + CommVault.</description>

      <title>Thinking out loud:  The cloud (IaaS) delusion</title>
      <link>https://ericcsinger.com/thinking-out-loud-the-cloud-iaas-delusion/</link>

      <guid>https://ericcsinger.com/thinking-out-loud-the-cloud-iaas-delusion/</guid>
      <description>Introduction: Just so weâre all being honest here, Iâm not going to sit here and lie about how Iâm not biased and Iâm looking at both sides 100% objectively. I mean Iâm going to try to, but I have a slant towards on prem, and a lot of that is based on my experience and research with IaaS solutions as they exist now. My view of course is subject to change as technology advances (as anyones should), and I think with enough time, IaaS will get to a point where its a no brainer, but I donât think that time is yet for the masses.</description>

      <title>Powershell Scripting: Get-ECSVMwareVirtualDiskToWindowsLogicalDiskMapping</title>

      <description>Building off my last function Get-ECSPhysicalDiskToLogicalDiskMapping : which took a windows physical disk and mapped it to a windows logical disk, this function will take a VMware virtual disk and map it to a windows logical disk.
This function has the following dependencies and assumptions:
It depends on my windows physical to logical function and all its dependencies. It assumes your VM name matches your windows server name It assumes youâve pre-loaded the VMware powershell snap-in.</description>

      <description>I figured it was about time to knock out something a little technical for a change, and I figured Iâd start with this little function, which is part of a larger script that Iâll talk more about later.
There may be a time where you need to find the relationship between a physical disk drive and your logical drive. In my case, I had a colleague ask me if there was an easy way to match a VMware disk to a Window disk so he could extend the proper drive.</description>

Intro: To begin with, as you can tell, Iâve been running Nimble Storage for a few years at this point, and I felt like it was time to provide a review of both the good and bad. When I was looking at storage a few years ago, it was hard to find reviews of vendors, they were very short, non-informative, clearly paid for, or posts by obvious fan boys.</description>

      <title>Backup Storage Part 5: Realization of a failure</title>

      <description>No one likes admitting theyâre wrong, and Iâm certainly no different. Being a mature person means being able to admit youâre wrong, even if it means doing it publicly, and that is what Iâm about to do.
Iâve been writing this series slowly over the past few months, and during that time, Iâve noticed an increasing number of instances where my storage space virtual disks NTFS would go corrupt. Basically, Iâd see Veeam errors writing to our repository, and when investigating, I would find files not deleting (old VBKâs).</description>

      <description>Just wanted to post this quick, and I may have time to do a more through post later, but this will do for now.
In our backup solution, we had to join together two solutions, CommVault and Veeam. Veeeam backed up the data to disk and CommVault backed the data up to tape. The problem with this solution is the systems were unaware of each other. We really needed a solution that could take disperate systems and jobs, and basically link them together in a workflow.</description>

      <title>Backup Storage Part 4a: Windows Storage Spaces Gotcha&#39;s</title>

      <description>The pro and the con of a software defined storage is that its not a turn key solution. Not only do you have the power to customize your solution, you also have no choice but to design your solution. With Storage Spaces, we figured most of this stuff out before selecting it as our new backup storage solution. At the time, there was some documentation on storage spaces, but it was very much a learning process.</description>

      <title>Backup Storage Part 3d: Traditional SAN / NAS</title>

      <description>Of all the types of storage we looked at, this was the one type that I kept coming back to. It was a storage technology that I had the most personal experience with, and having just finished implementing my companies first SAN, I was pretty well versed in what was out on the market.
There were other reasons as well. Traditional storage is arguably the most familiar storage technology out there.</description>

      <description>Anyone whoâs heard the word âcloudâ as it pertains to technology knows its a fairly nebulous term. About the only thing people seem to grasp is that its means ânot in my datacenter or homeâ. When we talk about âcloud storageâ the term is still fuzzy, but at least we know it has something to do with storage. For this post, Iâm going to be writing about two specific types of storage outlined below.</description>

      <description>While evaluating EMCâs DataDomain solution, our EMC rep suggested we also take a look at their Isilon product. Not being a person to turn down a chance to check out new technology I happily obliged.
Before we get into my thoughts on Isilon, letâs go over a simplistic overview of what scale out storage is, and what makes it different from say an EMC VNX.
SANs like the EMC VNX are what Iâll refer to as more traditional storage.</description>

      <guid>https://ericcsinger.com/backup-storage-part-3a-deduplication-targets/</guid>
      <description>Deduplication and backup kind of go hand in hand, so we couldnât evaluate backup storage and not check out this segment. We had two primary goals for a deduplication appliance.
Reduce racks space while enabling us to store more data. As you know in part 1, we had a lot of rack space being consumed. While we werenât hurting for rack space in our primary DC, we were in our DR DC.</description>

      <description>When VMware first announced vSAN, the premiss of the solution was just pure awesomeness. After all, VMware has the best hypervisor (fact, not opinion), theyâre in the process of honing what I think will be a Cisco butt kicking software defined network solution. Basically vSAN was the only missing piece to building a software defined datacenter. However, like NSX, I just donât think vSAN is at a point where they can replace my tried and true shared storage solution.</description>

      <description>In part 1, I went over our legacy backup storage solution, and why it needed to change. This section, Iâm going to outline what we were looking for in our next storage refresh.
Also, just to give you a little more context, while evaluating storage, were also looking at new backup solutions. CommVault, Veeam, EMC (Avamar and Networker), NetVault, Microsoft DPM, and a handful of cloud solutions. Point being, there were a lot of moving parts and a lot of things to consider.</description>

      <description>Introduction: This is going to be a multi-part series where I walk you through the whole process we took in evaluating, implementing and living with a new backup storage solution. While its not a perfect solution, given the parameters we had to work within, I think we ended up with some very decent storage.
Backup Storage Part 1: The âWhyâ it needed to change Last year my team and I began a project to overhaul our backup solution and part of that solution involved researching some new storage options.</description>

      <description>I see this come up occasionally and I really donât get why its always an âx is better than yâ. A lot of times folks are talking about what works best for them in their world, and for all intents and purposes stating that if its best for them, its best for all. Iâd like to challenge this reasoning and also challenge the notion that both a CLI and GUI have their place.</description>

      <title>Thinking out loud: Core vs. Socket Licensing</title>

      <guid>https://ericcsinger.com/thinking-out-loud-core-vs.-socket-licensing/</guid>
      <description>I recall when Microsoft changed their SQL licensing model from per socket to per core. It was not a well received model and it certainly wasnât following the industry standard. Iâd even say it ranked up there with VMware vRAM tax debacle. The big difference being that VMware reversed their licensing model. To this day, other than perhaps Oracle, I donât know of any other product / manufacture using this model.</description>
