<p>I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;re all familiar with the quote &ldquo;Those who don&rsquo;t know history are doomed to repeat it.&rdquo;  In technology, we&rsquo;ve seen various waves of solutions repeating themselves.  Often each wave has evolved in a way that it solves previous issues.  Thus the negatives of the historical waves are not applicable, or mitigated.</p>
<p>In this article, I&rsquo;m going to talk about the infrastructure trends I&rsquo;ve seen in my career.  We are repeating ourselves, and in many ways, repeating the problems we&rsquo;ve tried to avoid.</p>]]></description>

      <title>PGAdmin Azure AD Authentication Token Renewal</title>

<p>Microsoft recently released Azure Active Directory (AzureAD) authentication support for Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server (AzPG).  I&rsquo;m a huge proponent of leveraging AzureAD whenever possible, over local accounts, keys, etc.  There all sorts of pros to this approach, none of which I&rsquo;m going to dive into.</p>
<p>What we will dive into, is the fact that PGAdmin, the most popular GUI for PostgreSQL, doesn&rsquo;t natively support Azure AD authentication, and how I worked around that.  It&rsquo;s not that you can&rsquo;t login to AzPG with AzureAD.  Rather the issue is that the token expires after 60 minutes (max), and you have to reconnect to the server.  This is frustrating when dealing with a single server, and unusable when dealing with many.</p>]]></description>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve blogged about naming conventions.  For most it&rsquo;s not an interesting topic, and for many, it&rsquo;s the last thing on their mind.  While I would never say I get joy out of creating a good naming convention, I do get a sense of satisfaction and pride.  For this blog post, I want to document how I&rsquo;ve tackled getting consistent naming out of an inconsistent Azure location name.</p>]]></description>

<p>I had been troubleshooting a fairly tricky DNS resolution issue and wanted to share what I learned with all of you.  Most of the DNS lookup issues I&rsquo;ve encountered in my career, have been the result of a misconfigured zone, record, or a server outage.  I cannot recall a time with a Windows DNS server, where I&rsquo;ve had to adjust default setting, but that&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;ve had to do.</p>]]></description>

<p>Whether you&rsquo;re new to ARM/Bicep or a pro, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve run into the issue of needing conditional properties.  Unfortunately, ARM and Bicep do not officially have functions built in to handle this natively.  At least not as of yet.  I was surprised when writing this, to not see a whole lot of articles showing how work around this.</p>
<p>In this series, I&rsquo;m going to show you a few ways you can work a round this.  All of them are convoluted, but they do work.  Each one will have pros and cons, and it will be up to you determine which one you like best.  Of course, you don&rsquo;t have to stick to one or other.

<p>As many know, I&rsquo;m a big fan of automation.  A lot of my blog posts have focused on leveraging PowerShell to do my bidding.  As my career has evolved, so have the tools I leverage.  In a cloud world, even scripting by itself can become to error prone and inconsistent.  Many have been leveraging IaC (Infrastructure as Code) to solve this problem.  I am one such person.  For years I&rsquo;ve had an on again / off again relationship with Azure ARM.  I&rsquo;ve always loved the idea of it, but the execution was tedious and cumbersome.  Fast forward to the last year with the release of Bicep, I&rsquo;ve come back to the idea of leveraging IaC more. Recently, I had an opportunity to deploy an entire multi-environment platform via IaC.  I can tell you, I&rsquo;ve not only deployed all infrastructure via Bicep, but continued to keep it up to date.  Meaning, not a simple one an done deployment.  Rather maintaining the lifecycle of the platform with IaC.</p>]]></description>

<p>Look we all know the running joke is &ldquo;Microsoft Security&rdquo; is an oxymoron.  Over the years though, Microsoft has made large strides in improving security.  In fact, one could make a case that they have defined newer standards that others have lacked.</p>
<p>That said, I&rsquo;d like to discuss an area that has left companies exposed for malicious intent.  Monitoring in a Microsoft Windows environment.</p>
<p>Finally, before continuing.   These are my opinions shaped from my own experience.  If you disagree, feel free to drop a comment at the bottom.</p>]]></description>

<p>Just wanted to get something super simple out there.  I was curious how many unattatched disks our Azure portal had and what it was costing us.  This little script will give us the basic answer to that question.</p>

<h2 id="the-script" data-numberify>The script<a class="anchor ms-1" href="#the-script"></a></h2>
<p>This will loop through all subscriptions and gather all disks with a status of &ldquo;unattatched&rdquo;.  Then it will try to find out how much they cost.  Don&rsquo;t trust this blindly of course. The results can be parsed in the variable named &ldquo;$All_Az_Disks_Unattached&rdquo;.</p>]]></description>

<p>Let&rsquo;s face it, removing a domain controller via the GUI is easy, but sometimes you just want to know how to automate something.  In my research there was a lot of resources on how to cleanup using the GUI, or via NTDS.  Nothing about utilizing PowerShell.</p>

<p>One of the things I&rsquo;ve learned in administering Azure, is singular tasks can take a long time.  When using the web GUI, it&rsquo;s not a big deal.  Start a new tab, while the task runs in the background.</p>
<p>What do you do when you&rsquo;re in PowerShell?  Something as simple as shutting down a VM, can sometimes take 5 - 15 minutes.  Your console is locked during that time.  You could start another Powershell session, but that&rsquo;s a pain.  There is of course Azure Resource Manager Templates, but they&rsquo;re complex for a lot of folks.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>This is the initial release of my WSUS module. This is a module I put together to properly organize a lot of my one off WSUS functions.</p>
<p>I have found these functions useful for reporting n the status of computers in WSUS in mass. Querying the DB directly, while not recommended, is much faster than using the API, and you can get a lot more information out of it.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I love chatting about tech and anytime I get to do so with folks like Josh Odgers, Cody Hosterman, Exchange Goddess, Dan the builder, Duncan Epping, Frank Denneman, Chrissy LeMair, etc. itâs a good day. Theyâre all IT celebrities in my books, and I failed to even scratch the surface of all the folks Iâm following / interact with. Some folks follow their sports heroes, I follow my IT heroâs.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Sorry itâs been so long since Iâve wrote anything. Iâve been busy with life and working on a new Powershell module. Iâm hoping to get back into the groove soon. Iâve been working on a few things at work that might be interesting to write about.</p>
<p>For now, Iâll leave you with this. Iâve released my 1.0.0 version of my WSUS Powershell module. Iâm not considering it âofficiallyâ released until I can start writing the wiki on how to use the module, but it is on the Powershell gallery and it is on my Github.</p>]]></description>

      <title>PSA: VM Backup hot add mode with Nimble NOS 5.x on vVOLs</title>
      <link>https://ericcsinger.com/psa-vm-backup-hot-add-mode-with-nimble-nos-5.x-on-vvols/</link>

      <guid>https://ericcsinger.com/psa-vm-backup-hot-add-mode-with-nimble-nos-5.x-on-vvols/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Just a quick pubic service announcement. If youâre on Nimble NOS 5.x and you use vVOLâs and youâre backing up VMâs with a vendor that uses the VDDK APIâs, you might want to confirm your VMâs are in fact using hot add mode.</p>
<p>We discovered by happen stance, that after upgrading our Nimble SAN from 4.x to 5.x, that any VM that was on a vVOL on that particular NOS version started failing to attach disks during a backup. This causes the backup mode to revert to NBD. At this stage, itâs unclear if itâs a problem specific with Nimble, VMware or CommVault. What I can say is that I have a case open with both Nimble and CommVault and Nimble has been able to reproduce the issue with CommVault + NOS 5.x. Veeam or other backup vendors have not been tested. This problem does not appear for VMâs on VMFS (5.x at least).</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I know I havenât been posting a lot, but thatâs because Iâve been busy developing my first public Powershell modules. This short post isnât to discuss the specifics of that, but rather my new strategy going forward.</p>
<p>Many of you probably know what GitHub is by now, but for those of you who donât, itâs pretty much the most popular version control system for code. While Iâm not a developer per se, I do have a lot of Powershell stuff I write, and I wanted to start getting more formal with how I organize and manage it.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I created a function while ago that utilizes the VMDK serial number to map which VMDK is used for a Windows volume. Starting with Windows 10 / Server 2016, I noticed that I could no longer see the serial number of a VMDK insides the OS. After reaching out to VMware, turned out to be a really simple fix.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>In general, I find DRS does a fantastic job of keeping VMâs happy. However, in the past, Iâve seen a number of unexplained situations where hosts in a cluster run out of memory when a VM goes from idle, to busy all of a sudden. In fact, this happened three times to us in a dedicated cluster for our SQL VMâs. What was unexplained wasnât how the host ran out of memory, that was pretty easy to track down. What was unexplained was why DRS didnât move any of the VMâs. In this cluster we had a lot of VMâs with restrictive rules, but there were plenty of VMâs on this host that could have been easily relocated to prevent the over-committing of memory.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction" data-numberify>Introduction:<a class="anchor ms-1" href="#introduction"></a></h1>
<p>We setup a decent number of SQL servers every year. Most of the time weâre migrating to a newer OS + SQL combo, but sometimes itâs for a new product. As you may have read in my virtualizing SQL post, one of the pros to virtualizing SQL, was having this ability. Having seen the ameba affect virtualization created for other systems, I knew this would soon happen with SQL as well. As such, I started developing a bunch of script blocks to automate setting up SQL a few years ago. Over that time, Iâve added more and more functionality, with the finally feature being able to setup a SQL AAG via Powershell. The only thing I donât have fully automated, is an AlwaysOn Failover Cluster, but thatâs because we donât deploy them typically.</p>]]></description>

<p>I know what youâre thinking, itâs 2017, why are you writing about virtualizing Microsoft SQL? Most are doing it after all. And even if theyâre not, thereâs this whole SQLaaS thing thatâs starting to take off, so why would anyone care? Well Iâm writing this as more of a reflection on virtualizing SQL. What works well, what doesnât, what lessons Iâve learned, what Iâm still learning, etc.</p>]]></description>

In fact, the more Iâve watched shows like Ice Road Truckers, and various documentaries about truckâin, the more I find that thereâs just not enough gratitude expressed for these folks.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction" data-numberify>Introduction:<a class="anchor ms-1" href="#introduction"></a></h1>
<p>I hate the WSUS reports built into the console. Theyâre slow, and when it comes to doing something useful with the data, itâs basically impossible. Thatâs why I wrote this function.</p>
<p>I wanted an ability to gather data on a given WSUS computer(s), and work with it in Powershell. This function gives me the ability to write scripts for bulk reports, automate my patching process (checking that all updates are done), and in general, gives me the same data the standard WSUS report does, but at a MUCH faster rate.</p>]]></description>

<p>These two functions by themselves arenât exactly sexy. Their main goal is to be used to feed my function Get-ECSWSUSComputerUpdatesStatusReport. Still, I can see some limited value to them outside of that use case.</p>
<p>One thing youâll notice, is iâm hitting SQL directly instead of querying the WSUS APIs. Iâm doing this, despite it not being recommended, because itâs infinitely faster and far more flexible that the APIs.</p>]]></description>

<p>I donât know about all of you, but for me, VMware has been an uninspiring company over the last couple of years. VMworld was a time when I used to get excited. It used to mean big new features were coming, and the platform would evolve in nice big steps. However, over the last 5 â 7 years, VMware has gotten progressively disappointing. My disappointment however is not limited to the products alone, but the company culture as well.</p>]]></description>

<p>If you donât know by now, Iâm a huge PowerShell fan. Itâs my go to scripting language for anything related to Microsoft (and non-Microsoft) automation and administration. So when it came time to automating post exchange cumulative update setting, I was a bit surprised to see some of the code examples from Microsoft, not containing any PowerShell example. Surprised is probably the wrong word, how about annoyed? I mean, after all, this is not only the company that shoved this awesome scripting language down our throat, but also the very team that was the first one to have a comprehensive set of admin abilities via PowerShell. So if thatâs the case, why in the world, donât they have a single PS example for configuring client-specific message size limits?</p>]]></description>

<p>VMwareâs drivers are VIBS (but not all VIBS are drivers). So the key to knowing if you have the correct drivers is to find which VIB matches which PCI device. This function does that work for you.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>After updating WSUS to support Windows 10 newer update format, we noticed that our Windows 10 client werenât working. The error they were getting was 8024401c whenever we checked for updates (post WSUS upgrade). Initially we thought it was related to the WSUS upgrade, but found out that most of our systems hadnât been updating for a while. So we moved on to troubleshooting the client further. We found that the following GPO â<strong>Do not connect to any Windows Update Internet locationsâ</strong>  was not configured. After doing some digging we determined that this was put in place to prevent our clients from downloading updates from MS directly, which was originally happening. The weird thing to me was why were our clients going to MS anyway? We have WSUS, that is the point of WSUS? Disabling the setting resulted in us getting updates, but now they were coming from MS directly and not WSUS. Enabling <strong>or</strong> setting it to ânot configuredâ resulted in the lovely error.</p>]]></description>

<p>Backup and recovery is a rather dry topic, but itâs an important one. After all, whatâs more critical to your company than their data? You can have the best products in the world, but if disaster strikes and you donât have a good solution in place, it can make your recovery painful or even impossible. Still, many companies shirk investment in this segment. The good solutions (like the one Iâm about to discuss) cost a pretty penny, and thatâs capital that needs to be balanced with technology that makes or saves your company money. Still, insurance (and thatâs what backup is) is something thatâs typically on the back of companies minds.</p>]]></description>

<p>Let me give you a little back story before digging into the meat of this post. My team and I make a very concerted effort to keep our servers firmware and drivers updated. Weâve gone so far as to purchase software from Dell, implement a process on how firmware / drivers are to be updated, and ensuring that its routinely done every quarter. We do this because in general itâs a best practice, but also because weâve run into too many occasions where troubleshooting with a vendor stops (if it ever starts) very quickly if the drivers / firmware isnât recent. In essence, weâre doing our best to be diligent and proactive with keeping our servers healthy, secure and updated.</p>]]></description>

<p>One of the things Iâm struggling with, is how to balance the number of posts per naming convention. It would be easy in some ways to use a single post per server type, but it would also be overly redundant in many ways. I originally wrote a dedicated post to SQL server naming conventions, and realized that the logic behind its name is ultimately a similar logic for other server names. With that said, Iâve decided to create a consolidated post for server names. Iâll rehash the overall structure used for the SQL naming convention, and show you how its reusable for other servers.</p>]]></description>

At the time, I was in search of a solution that could help me glue together several disjointed systems in a workflow. Specifically, we were trying to integrate Veeam and CommVault backupâs together. Veeam was of course doing the VM backupâs, and CommVault was copying the Veeam files to tape. Weâve since moved on from Veeam, but JAMS has continued to be a vital part of our infrastructure.</p>]]></description>

<p>If youâre working in a Windows environment like me, you have to deal with 15 character limitations (at least if you care about NETBIOS resolution). Honestly, really cramps my style, but these conventions were written with that limitation in mind. If youâre using this for a Linux based server running MySQL or PostgreSQL, you might be able to get a little more detailed.</p>

<h1 id="multi-environment--cluster-or-standalone" data-numberify>Multi Environment / Cluster or standalone:<a class="anchor ms-1" href="#multi-environment--cluster-or-standalone"></a></h1>
<p>At my employer ASI, we have to contend with multiple applications, multiple environments for each application and in a lot of cases clusters. Trying to come up with a name that works for them all can be tough, but I think Iâve got a few good ones depending on your use cases.</p>]]></description>

<p>One thing that always kind of sucked with windows servers (and its even worse with Linux) is dealing with how to manage local administrator rights. Now I realize a lot of you just add yourself to the domain admins and use that account (not a security best practices) to administer your servers, but what about everyone and everything else that might need local admin access? What I have for you here is how I not only created a new naming conventions, but also how I tackled managing local administrator access in windows domain environment.</p>]]></description>

<p>If there was one area in IT that I tend to be fanatical about (some would say fanatical isnât a strong enough word), I would have to say its naming conventions. For me, learning about naming conventions in school and then seeing it put into practice in my first real gig, really enforced the concept that naming conventions are important. I actually consider myself pretty lucky in that respect because I donât think a lot of people have had the fortune of studying about the concept, let alone working for a company that had a decent naming convention. After walking fresh into two different employers and seeing the mess they made, and also working through a few mergers, I know that good naming conventions donât always exist.</p>]]></description>

<p>If youâre not in a DevOps based shop, or living under a rock, you may not know that Microsoft has been working on a solution that by all accounts sounds like its poised to usurp GPO / GPP. The solution Iâm talking about is Desired State Configuration, or DSC. According to all the marketing hype, DSC is the next best thing for IT since virtualization. If the vision comes to fruition, GPO and GPP will be a legacy solution. Enterprise mobility management will be used for desktops and DSC will be used for servers. Given that I currently manage 700 VMâs and about an equal number of desktops, I figured why not take it for a test drive. So I stood up a simplistic environment, and played around with it for a full week and my conclusion is this.</p>]]></description>

<p>When I started at my current employer, one of the things I wasnât super keen on was having to deal with Dell hardware. I had some previous experience with Dell servers, none of which was good. My former employer was an HP shop that had converted from Dell, and early on in my SysAdmin gig, I had the misfortune of having to work with some of the older Dell servers (r850 as an example).</p>]]></description>

<p>In general, Iâm not a huge fan of hyper converged infrastructure. To me, its more âhypeâ than substance at the moment. It was born out of web scale infrastructure like Google, Facebook, etc. and IMO, that is still the area where itâs better suited. The only enterprise layer where I see HCI being a good fit is VDI, other than that, almost every other enterprise workload would be better suited on new school shared storage. I could probably go into a ton of reasons why I personally see shared storage still being the preferred architecture for enterprises, but instead Iâll focus on one area that if adopted might change my view (slightly). You see, there is a balance between the best and good enough. Shared storage IMO is the best, but HCI could be good enough.</p>]]></description>

What makes matters worse is when you have to deal with MORE tapes.</p>]]></description>

If you have any strong feeling either way, maybe its worth posting your view in their comments or mine.</p>
<p>Me, my views are in their comments, but suffice to say, I prefer thick clients over web clients all day long. I love having a web client as a backup or as an alternative, but not as my only option. Now I get why theyâre doing it. And maybe if they had proven in vSphere 6 that they were capable of releasing a fully featured high performance web client, I wouldât be so against it, but VMware has a â0â success rate with all their web client releases with one possible exception being the new host client. Even there, its still not on feature parity to the c#, and that is also true for vCenter as well.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I was scanning through my LinkedIn feed the other day and stumbled across an interesting picture / chart showing common mistakes that interview candidates make posted by a former colleague. To basically summarize, it was a culmination of physical characteristics (slouching, not smiling, clothing not too trendy, but not too outdated, etc.), knowing a lot about the company and position, and various other common doâs and donâts.</p>
<p>My first reaction was âno duhâ, but then I paused for a moment and said to myself âWhy?â Does this criteria really lead to you getting the best candidate for the position or is it actually filtering out the best candidate for the position? It actually got me a little annoyed just thinking about how shallow someone recruiting must be if these were deciding factors. Then I started thinking about other facets of recruiting that just seem not only outdated, but also likely detrimental to a company finding the best possible candidates. Itâs actually bothered me enough that I felt compelled to get a blog post written about what I think is wrong on not only the recruiting side, but also the candidates side too.</p>]]></description>

<li><strong>Collector</strong>: Its a windows or linux box that grabs the data you want monitored from your other servers. Its an agent that sits on a server and allows LM to either remotely poll other servers, or locally collect data.</li>
<li><strong>Datasource</strong>: This is a term used to describe a âmonitorâ. As an example, if I wanted to monitor a windows logical disk perfmon counter, that would be a datasource. If I have a script that checks for the status of an exchange database, that would be a datasource.</li>
<li><strong>Instance</strong>: A term used to describe a very specific item thatâs monitored by a datasource. For example, going back to the logical disk datasource. If you had a C: E: and F: drive, each drive is an individual instance. Some datasources are designed to collect multiple instances (like the example) others like âpingâ are not.</li>
<li><strong>Device:</strong> Anything that youâre monitoring. This is what LM license. A few examples, a windows server, linux server, switch. pdu, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="introduction" data-numberify>Introduction:<a class="anchor ms-1" href="#introduction"></a></h1>
<p>If weâre all honest, I think we can all agree that monitoring solutions suck. Its a little crass I know, but I think its a fitting word for this software class as a whole. Backup and monitoring are the two areas I always here folks say âthey all suck, this one just sucks a little lessâ. And that is really why we chose LogicMonitor. Its not that Iâm blown away with it as a solution, but it sucks a lot less then the other options out there. So you could say from my view theyâe the best, or you could say theyâre the least worst. Either way, we chose them over a number of other vendors, including the all so popular SolarWinds.</p>]]></description>

<p>These are my opinions, these are <strong>not</strong> facts. Take them with a grain of salt, and use your own judgement. These are also my personal views, not those of my employer.</p>
<p>Also, no one is paying me for this, no one asked me to write this. Itâs not un-biased, but its also not a hired review.</p>

<h1 id="introduction" data-numberify>Introduction:<a class="anchor ms-1" href="#introduction"></a></h1>
<p>As you may know from reading my backup storage series, we were going from a backup migration of native CommVault to Veeam + CommVault. I wanted to put together my experience living with Veeam as an almost complete backup solution replacement for the last year and half. Again, Iâm always looking for this type of stuff, but its always hard to find.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Thinking out loud:  The cloud (IaaS) delusion</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction" data-numberify>Introduction:<a class="anchor ms-1" href="#introduction"></a></h1>
<p>Just so weâre all being honest here, Iâm not going to sit here and lie about how Iâm not biased and Iâm looking at both sides 100% objectively. I mean Iâm going to try to, but I have a slant towards on prem, and a lot of that is based on my experience and research with IaaS solutions as they exist now. My view of course is subject to change as technology advances (as anyones should), and I think with enough time, IaaS will get to a point where its a no brainer, but I donât think that time is yet for the masses. Additionally, I think its worth noting that in general, like any technology, Iâm a fan of what makes my life easier, whatâs better for my employer, and whatâs financially sound. In many cases cloud fits those requirement, and I currently run and have run cloud solutions (long before being trendy). Iâm not anti cloud, Iâm anti throwing money away, which is what IaaS is mostly doing.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Building off my last function <a href="https://github.com/ericcsinger/powershell_microsoft_windows_get-ecsphysicaldisktologicaldiskmapping" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get-ECSPhysicalDiskToLogicalDiskMapping<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a>: which took a windows physical disk and mapped it to a windows logical disk, this function will take a VMware virtual disk and map it to a windows logical disk.</p>
<p>This function has the following dependencies and assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>It depends on my windows physical to logical function and all its dependencies.</li>
<li>It assumes your VM name matches your windows server name</li>
<li>It assumes youâve pre-loaded the VMware powershell snap-in.</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic way the function works, is it starts by getting the windows physical to logical mapping and storing that in an array. This array houses two key peaces of information.</p>]]></description>

<p>There may be a time where you need to find the relationship between a physical disk drive and your logical drive. In my case, I had a colleague ask me if there was an easy way to match a VMware disk to a Window disk so he could extend the proper drive. After digging into it a bit, I determined it was possible, but it was going to take a little work. One of the prerequisites is to first find which drive letter belongs to which physical disk (from windows view).</p>]]></description>

<p>To begin with, as you can tell, Iâve been running Nimble Storage for a few years at this point, and I felt like it was time to provide a review of both the good and bad. When I was looking at storage a few years ago, it was hard to find reviews of vendors, they were very short, non-informative, clearly paid for, or posts by obvious fan boys.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Backup Storage Part 5: Realization of a failure</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>No one likes admitting theyâre wrong, and Iâm certainly no different. Being a mature person means being able to admit youâre wrong, even if it means doing it publicly, and that is what Iâm about to do.</p>
<p>Iâve been writing this series slowly over the past few months, and during that time, Iâve noticed an increasing number of instances where my storage space virtual disks NTFS would go corrupt. Basically, Iâd see Veeam errors writing to our repository, and when investigating, I would find files not deleting (old VBKâs). When trying to manually delete them, they would either throw some error, or they would act like they were deleted (theyâd disappear), but then return only a second later. The only way to fix this (temporarily) was to do a check disk, which requires taking the disk offline. When you have a number of backup jobs going at anytime, this means something is going to crash, and it was my luck that it was always in middle of a 4TB+ VM.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Just wanted to post this quick, and I may have time to do a more through post later, but this will do for now.</p>
<p>In our backup solution, we had to join together two solutions, CommVault and Veeam. Veeeam backed up the data to disk and CommVault backed the data up to tape. The problem with this solution is the systems were unaware of each other. We really needed a solution that could take disperate systems and jobs, and basically link them together in a workflow. After a lot of searching we found this AWESOME product from MVP systems called âJAMS (Job automation management scheduler).</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The pro and the con of a software defined storage is that its not a turn key solution. Not only do you have the power to customize your solution, you also have no choice but to design your solution. With Storage Spaces, we figured most of this stuff out before selecting it as our new backup storage solution. At the time, there was some documentation on storage spaces, but it was very much a learning process. Most âhow toâsâ were demonstrated inside labs, so I found some aspects of the documentation to be useless, but I was able to glean enough information, to at least know what to think about.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Backup Storage Part 3d: Traditional SAN / NAS</title>
      <link>https://ericcsinger.com/backup-storage-part-3d-traditional-san-/-nas/</link>

      <guid>https://ericcsinger.com/backup-storage-part-3d-traditional-san-/-nas/</guid>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Of all the types of storage we looked at, this was the one type that I kept coming back to. It was a storage technology that I had the most personal experience with, and having just finished implementing my companies first SAN, I was pretty well versed in what was out on the market.</p>
<p>There were other reasons as well. Traditional storage is arguably the most familiar storage technology out there. Even if you donât understand SAN, you probably have a basic understanding of local RAID and to some degree, that knowledge is far more transferable to traditional storage, than say something like a scale out solution. More disks generally = faster, RAID 10 = good for writes and 7k drives are slower than 10k drives. Iâm over simplifying on purpose, but you can see where Iâm coming from. The point is, adopting a storage solution where existing skills can transfer is a big win when you donât have time to be an expert in everything. On top of that, you can NOT beat the cost per GB of traditional storage nor the performance edge of traditional storage compared to all its fancier alternatives. Iâm not saying there arenât cases where deduplication targets will offer better costs per GB, nor am I saying scale out or cloud donât have their other winning use cases. However, as a general purpose, do a little bit of everything good and few things great, you canât beat traditional storage.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Anyone whoâs heard the word âcloudâ as it pertains to technology knows its a fairly nebulous term. About the only thing people seem to grasp is that its means ânot in my datacenter or homeâ. When we talk about âcloud storageâ the term is still fuzzy, but at least we know it has something to do with storage. For this post, Iâm going to be writing about two specific types of storage outlined below.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>While evaluating EMCâs DataDomain solution, our EMC rep suggested we also take a look at their Isilon product. Not being a person to turn down a chance to check out new technology I happily obliged.</p>
<p>Before we get into my thoughts on Isilon, letâs go over a simplistic overview of what scale out storage is, and what makes it different from say an EMC VNX.</p>
<p>SANs like the EMC VNX are what Iâll refer to as more traditional storage. Typically theyâre deployed with two controllers, and each controller shares access to one or more JBODs. Within this architecture, there are a few typical âlimitationsâ. Iâm putting limitations in quotes as in a lot cases most folks donât run into these limitations when a system is properly designed.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Deduplication and backup kind of go hand in hand, so we couldnât evaluate backup storage and not check out this segment. We had two primary goals for a deduplication appliance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce racks space while enabling us to store more data. As you know in part 1, we had a lot of rack space being consumed. While we werenât hurting for rack space in our primary DC, we were in our DR DC.</li>
<li>We were hoping that something like a deduplication target would finally enable us to get rid of tape and replicate our data to our DR site (instead of sneakernet).</li>
</ol>
<p>For those of you not particularly versed in deduplicated storage, there are a few things to keep in mind.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>When VMware first announced vSAN, the premiss of the solution was just pure awesomeness. After all, VMware has the best hypervisor (fact, not opinion), theyâre in the process of honing what I think will be a Cisco butt kicking software defined network solution. Basically vSAN was the only missing piece to building a software defined datacenter. However, like NSX, I just donât think vSAN is at a point where they can replace my tried and true shared storage solution. Thats not a knock against HyperConvergence (although I have my reservations with the architecture as a whole), rather VMwareâs current implementation.</p>]]></description>

CommVault, Veeam, EMC (Avamar and Networker), NetVault, Microsoft DPM, and a handful of cloud solutions. Point being, there were a lot of moving parts and a lot of things to consider. Iâll dive more into this in the coming sections, but wanted to let you know it was more than just a simple storage refresh.</p>]]></description>

<p>This is going to be a multi-part series where I walk you through the whole process we took in evaluating, implementing and living with a new backup storage solution. While its not a perfect solution, given the parameters we had to work within, I think we ended up with some very decent storage.</p>

<h1 id="backup-storage-part-1-the-why-it-needed-to-change" data-numberify>Backup Storage Part 1: The âWhyâ it needed to change<a class="anchor ms-1" href="#backup-storage-part-1-the-why-it-needed-to-change"></a></h1>
<p>Last year my team and I began a project to overhaul our backup solution and part of that solution involved researching some new storage options. At the time, we ran what most folks would on a budget, which is simply a server, with some local DAS. It was a Dell 2900 (IIRC) with 6 MD1000âs and 1 MD1200. The solution was originally designed to manage about 10TB of data, and really was never expected to handle what ultimately ended up being much greater than that. The solution was less than ideal for a lot of reasons that Iâm sharing below.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>I recall when Microsoft changed their SQL licensing model from per socket to per core. It was not a well received model and it certainly wasnât following the industry standard. Iâd even say it ranked up there with VMware vRAM tax debacle. The big difference being that VMware reversed their licensing model. To this day, other than perhaps Oracle, I donât know of any other product / manufacture using this model. And you know what, its a shame.</p>]]></description>
