      <description><![CDATA[Introduction It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve blogged about naming conventions. For most it&rsquo;s not an interesting topic, and for many, it&rsquo;s the last thing on their mind. While I would never say I get joy out of creating a good naming convention, I do get a sense of satisfaction and pride. For this blog post, I want to document how I&rsquo;ve tackled getting consistent naming out of an inconsistent Azure location name.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Introduction I had been troubleshooting a fairly tricky DNS resolution issue and wanted to share what I learned with all of you. Most of the DNS lookup issues I&rsquo;ve encountered in my career, have been the result of a misconfigured zone, record, or a server outage. I cannot recall a time with a Windows DNS server, where I&rsquo;ve had to adjust default setting, but that&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;ve had to do.]]></description>

Series Introduction Whether you&rsquo;re new to ARM/Bicep or a pro, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve run into the issue of needing conditional properties. Unfortunately, ARM and Bicep do not officially have functions built in to handle this natively. At least not as of yet. I was surprised when writing this, to not see a whole lot of articles showing how work around this.
In this series, I&rsquo;m going to show you a few ways you can work a round this.]]></description>

Introduction As many know, I&rsquo;m a big fan of automation. A lot of my blog posts have focused on leveraging PowerShell to do my bidding. As my career has evolved, so have the tools I leverage. In a cloud world, even scripting by itself can become to error prone and inconsistent. Many have been leveraging IaC (Infrastructure as Code) to solve this problem. I am one such person.
