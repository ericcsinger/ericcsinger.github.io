<p>I know what you’re thinking, it’s 2017, why are you writing about virtualizing Microsoft SQL? Most are doing it after all. And even if they’re not, there’s this whole SQLaaS thing that’s starting to take off, so why would anyone care? Well I’m writing this as more of a reflection on virtualizing SQL. What works well, what doesn’t, what lessons I’ve learned, what I’m still learning, etc.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Review: 877stockcar.com exotic experiences</title>

<p>This post is 100% off topic, it’s about my “exotic car” experience through 877stockcar.com. In general, my blog is for tech stuff, but I figure it might be fun to write about something non-tech for once. This is about the <a href="https://877stockcar.com/experiences/exotic-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://877stockcar.com/experiences/exotic-experiences/<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a> located at Pocono Raceway.</p>
<p>I wanted to write this for anyone that might be thinking of dropping up to $700 on their package, so you know what you’re in for. My wife got me the mid-tier package for Christmas (best gift ever) because she knows I’m a pretty big car nut.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Quicky Review: GPO/GPP vs. DSC</title>
      <link>https://ericcsinger.com/quicky-review-gpo/gpp-vs.-dsc/</link>

<p>If you’re not in a DevOps based shop, or living under a rock, you may not know that Microsoft has been working on a solution that by all accounts sounds like its poised to usurp GPO / GPP. The solution I’m talking about is Desired State Configuration, or DSC. According to all the marketing hype, DSC is the next best thing for IT since virtualization. If the vision comes to fruition, GPO and GPP will be a legacy solution. Enterprise mobility management will be used for desktops and DSC will be used for servers. Given that I currently manage 700 VM’s and about an equal number of desktops, I figured why not take it for a test drive. So I stood up a simplistic environment, and played around with it for a full week and my conclusion is this.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Review: 2.5 years with Nimble Storage</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I’m not getting paid for this review, nor have I been asked to do this by anyone. These views are my own, and not my employers, and they’re opinions not facts .</p>

<h1 id="intro" data-numberify>Intro:<a class="anchor ms-1" href="#intro"></a></h1>
<p>To begin with, as you can tell, I’ve been running Nimble Storage for a few years at this point, and I felt like it was time to provide a review of both the good and bad. When I was looking at storage a few years ago, it was hard to find reviews of vendors, they were very short, non-informative, clearly paid for, or posts by obvious fan boys.</p>]]></description>
