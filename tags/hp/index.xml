      <description>Disclaimer:These are opinions, not facts and these opinions are mine, not my employers.
Introduction:Upon receiving the news that HP was to acquire Nimble, I can’t say I was exactly thrilled. Nothing personal against HP, they make great servers, but I like Nimble the way it is right now. None the less, I know the industry is moving in a direction where its either get big, or get out. There is a huge storm “cloud” looming, and if you’re an on premises solution, its going to be a scary time in the coming years.</description>
