      <description>Introduction:This post is 100% off topic, it’s about my “exotic car” experience through 877stockcar.com. In general, my blog is for tech stuff, but I figure it might be fun to write about something non-tech for once. This is about the https://877stockcar.com/experiences/exotic-experiences/ located at Pocono Raceway.
I wanted to write this for anyone that might be thinking of dropping up to $700 on their package, so you know what you’re in for.</description>
