Series IntroductionWhether you&amp;rsquo;re new to ARM/Bicep or a pro, I&amp;rsquo;m sure you&amp;rsquo;ve run into the issue of needing conditional properties. Unfortunately, ARM and Bicep do not officially have functions built in to handle this natively. At least not as of yet. I was surprised when writing this, to not see a whole lot of articles showing how work around this.
In this series, I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you a few ways you can work a round this.</description>

As my career has evolved, so have the tools I leverage. In a cloud world, even scripting by itself can become to error prone and inconsistent.

The tracking of them is a PITA, having to physically manage them is a PITA, dealing with tape library issues is a PITA, dealing with tape encryption is a PITA, running out of tapes is a PITA, dealing with legal hold for tapes is a PITA, and I could keep going on with the many ways that tape just sucks.</description>
