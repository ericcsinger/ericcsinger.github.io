<h2 id="series-introduction" data-numberify>Series Introduction<a class="anchor ms-1" href="#series-introduction"></a></h2>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re new to ARM/Bicep or a pro, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve run into the issue of needing conditional properties.  Unfortunately, ARM and Bicep do not officially have functions built in to handle this natively.  At least not as of yet.  I was surprised when writing this, to not see a whole lot of articles showing how work around this.</p>
<p>In this series, I&rsquo;m going to show you a few ways you can work a round this.  All of them are convoluted, but they do work.  Each one will have pros and cons, and it will be up to you determine which one you like best.  Of course, you don&rsquo;t have to stick to one or other.  Like most things in technology, use what works best in your situation.</p>]]></description>

      <title>IaC Creativity: Introduction</title>

<h2 id="introduction" data-numberify>Introduction<a class="anchor ms-1" href="#introduction"></a></h2>
<p>As many know, I&rsquo;m a big fan of automation.  A lot of my blog posts have focused on leveraging PowerShell to do my bidding.  As my career has evolved, so have the tools I leverage.  In a cloud world, even scripting by itself can become to error prone and inconsistent.  Many have been leveraging IaC (Infrastructure as Code) to solve this problem.  I am one such person.  For years I&rsquo;ve had an on again / off again relationship with Azure ARM.  I&rsquo;ve always loved the idea of it, but the execution was tedious and cumbersome.  Fast forward to the last year with the release of Bicep, I&rsquo;ve come back to the idea of leveraging IaC more. Recently, I had an opportunity to deploy an entire multi-environment platform via IaC.  I can tell you, I&rsquo;ve not only deployed all infrastructure via Bicep, but continued to keep it up to date.  Meaning, not a simple one an done deployment.  Rather maintaining the lifecycle of the platform with IaC.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Quicky Review: GPO/GPP vs. DSC</title>

<p>If you’re not in a DevOps based shop, or living under a rock, you may not know that Microsoft has been working on a solution that by all accounts sounds like its poised to usurp GPO / GPP. The solution I’m talking about is Desired State Configuration, or DSC. According to all the marketing hype, DSC is the next best thing for IT since virtualization. If the vision comes to fruition, GPO and GPP will be a legacy solution. Enterprise mobility management will be used for desktops and DSC will be used for servers. Given that I currently manage 700 VM’s and about an equal number of desktops, I figured why not take it for a test drive. So I stood up a simplistic environment, and played around with it for a full week and my conclusion is this.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Problem Solving: CommVault tape usage</title>

<p>I hate dealing with tapes, pretty much every aspect of them. The tracking of them is a PITA, having to physically manage them is a PITA, dealing with tape library issues is a PITA, dealing with tape encryption is a PITA, running out of tapes is a PITA, dealing with legal hold for tapes is a PITA, and I could keep going on with the many ways that tape just sucks. What makes matters worse is when you have to deal with MORE tapes.</p>]]></description>
