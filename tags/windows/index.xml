      <description><![CDATA[<p>Version: 1.0.1</p>

<h2 id="introduction" data-numberify>Introduction<a class="anchor ms-1" href="#introduction"></a></h2>
<p>Look we all know the running joke is &ldquo;Microsoft Security&rdquo; is an oxymoron.  Over the years though, Microsoft has made large strides in improving security.  In fact, one could make a case that they have defined newer standards that others have lacked.</p>
<p>That said, I&rsquo;d like to discuss an area that has left companies exposed for malicious intent.  Monitoring in a Microsoft Windows environment.</p>
<p>Finally, before continuing.   These are my opinions shaped from my own experience.  If you disagree, feel free to drop a comment at the bottom.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Backup Storage Part 4a: Windows Storage Spaces Gotcha&#39;s</title>
      <link>https://ericcsinger.com/backup-storage-part-4a-windows-storage-spaces-gotchas/</link>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The pro and the con of a software defined storage is that its not a turn key solution. Not only do you have the power to customize your solution, you also have no choice but to design your solution. With Storage Spaces, we figured most of this stuff out before selecting it as our new backup storage solution. At the time, there was some documentation on storage spaces, but it was very much a learning process. Most “how to’s” were demonstrated inside labs, so I found some aspects of the documentation to be useless, but I was able to glean enough information, to at least know what to think about.</p>]]></description>
