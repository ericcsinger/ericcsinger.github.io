      <description>I love chatting about tech and anytime I get to do so with folks like Josh Odgers, Cody Hosterman, Exchange Goddess, Dan the builder, Duncan Epping, Frank Denneman, Chrissy LeMair, etc. it’s a good day. They’re all IT celebrities in my books, and I failed to even scratch the surface of all the folks I’m following / interact with. Some folks follow their sports heroes, I follow my IT hero’s.</description>

      <title>Thinking out loud: Hyper converged storages missing link</title>
      <link>http://ericcsinger.com/thinking-out-loud-hyper-converged-storages-missing-link/</link>

      <description>Introduction:In general, I’m not a huge fan of hyper converged infrastructure. To me, its more “hype” than substance at the moment. It was born out of web scale infrastructure like Google, Facebook, etc. and IMO, that is still the area where it’s better suited. The only enterprise layer where I see HCI being a good fit is VDI, other than that, almost every other enterprise workload would be better suited on new school shared storage.</description>

      <title>Review: 2.5 years with Nimble Storage</title>
      <link>http://ericcsinger.com/review-2.5-years-with-nimble-storage/</link>

      <description>Disclaimer: I’m not getting paid for this review, nor have I been asked to do this by anyone. These views are my own, and not my employers, and they’re opinions not facts .
Intro:To begin with, as you can tell, I’ve been running Nimble Storage for a few years at this point, and I felt like it was time to provide a review of both the good and bad. When I was looking at storage a few years ago, it was hard to find reviews of vendors, they were very short, non-informative, clearly paid for, or posts by obvious fan boys.</description>

      <title>Backup Storage Part 4a: Windows Storage Spaces Gotcha&#39;s</title>

      <description>The pro and the con of a software defined storage is that its not a turn key solution. Not only do you have the power to customize your solution, you also have no choice but to design your solution. With Storage Spaces, we figured most of this stuff out before selecting it as our new backup storage solution. At the time, there was some documentation on storage spaces, but it was very much a learning process.</description>

      <title>Backup Storage Part 3c: Cloud Storage</title>

      <description>Anyone who’s heard the word “cloud” as it pertains to technology knows its a fairly nebulous term. About the only thing people seem to grasp is that its means “not in my datacenter or home”. When we talk about “cloud storage” the term is still fuzzy, but at least we know it has something to do with storage. For this post, I’m going to be writing about two specific types of storage outlined below.</description>

      <title>Backup Storage Part 3a: Deduplication Targets</title>
      <link>http://ericcsinger.com/backup-storage-part-3a-deduplication-targets/</link>

      <description>Deduplication and backup kind of go hand in hand, so we couldn’t evaluate backup storage and not check out this segment. We had two primary goals for a deduplication appliance.
 Reduce racks space while enabling us to store more data. As you know in part 1, we had a lot of rack space being consumed. While we weren’t hurting for rack space in our primary DC, we were in our DR DC.</description>
