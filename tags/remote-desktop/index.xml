      <description>RDP: An internal error has occurredProblem overviewOne of my colleagues hit me up about an issue they were seeing when trying to RDP into a DC. The error from RDP was &amp;ldquo;An internal error has occurred&amp;rdquo;. Totally useful right :-).
We could console in so that was a slight sigh of relief.
Other symptomsWhen I consoled into the system and look at the event logs, the following event entry was created after each RDP attempt.</description>
