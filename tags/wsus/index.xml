      <description><![CDATA[This is the initial release of my WSUS module. This is a module I put together to properly organize a lot of my one off WSUS functions.
I have found these functions useful for reporting n the status of computers in WSUS in mass. Querying the DB directly, while not recommended, is much faster than using the API, and you can get a lot more information out of it.
Functions released in this module:Connect-ECSWSUSDatabase Get-ECSWSUSComputerTarget Get-ECSWSUSComputerTargetGroup Get-ECSWSUSComputerTargetInTargetGroup Get-ECSWSUSComputerTargetReport Get-ECSWSUSUpdate Test-ECSWSUSDatabaseConnected You can learn more about the module here.]]></description>

      <title>Powershell Scripting: Get-ECSWSUSComputerUpdatesStatusReport</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Introduction:I hate the WSUS reports built into the console. They’re slow, and when it comes to doing something useful with the data, it’s basically impossible. That’s why I wrote this function.
I wanted an ability to gather data on a given WSUS computer(s), and work with it in Powershell. This function gives me the ability to write scripts for bulk reports, automate my patching process (checking that all updates are done), and in general, gives me the same data the standard WSUS report does, but at a MUCH faster rate.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Hi Folks,
After updating WSUS to support Windows 10 newer update format, we noticed that our Windows 10 client weren’t working. The error they were getting was 8024401c whenever we checked for updates (post WSUS upgrade). Initially we thought it was related to the WSUS upgrade, but found out that most of our systems hadn’t been updating for a while. So we moved on to troubleshooting the client further. We found that the following GPO “Do not connect to any Windows Update Internet locations” was not configured.]]></description>

      <title>SQL Query: Microsoft – WSUS – Computers Update Status</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Sometimes the WSUS console, just doesn’t give you the info you need, or it doesn’t provide it in a format you want. This query is for one of those examples. This query can be used in multiple ways to show the update status of a computer, computers or computer in a computer target. For me, I wanted to see the update status, without worrying about what non-applicable updates were installed. I also, didn’t care about updates that I didn’t approve, which was another reason I wrote this query.]]></description>

      <title>SQL Query: Microsoft WSUS Computers to Computer Target</title>

      <description><![CDATA[This is a simple query you can use map your computers to their various targets in a nice easy to export table. I’d love to say the script is sexier than that, but its really not. You can find the sql query here.
There is only one section worth mentioning because it can change the way a computer is mapped to a computer target.
By default, my query returns the computer target location based on the child object.]]></description>
