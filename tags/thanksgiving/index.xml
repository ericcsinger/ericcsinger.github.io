      <description>I know I’m totally guilty of saying expletives with regards to truckers. Being honest, most of it is due to my own impatience / selfishness. Still once I realize, that I’m getting upset about a person that’s driving a 40-ton vehicle cautiously, things tend to fall back into perspective. In fact, the more I’ve watched shows like Ice Road Truckers, and various documentaries about truck’in, the more I find that there’s just not enough gratitude expressed for these folks.</description>

      <description>Series Introduction:Back in October I had a grand plan to have 23 days of thanks. Unfortunately, life got in the way, and I never had the time to pre-write all the posts I wanted to. Rather than giving up, I’m going to punch out as many as I can before the 24th. Since I want to focus on the month of thanks, by giving thanks, I’m not going to be writing any technical posts.</description>
