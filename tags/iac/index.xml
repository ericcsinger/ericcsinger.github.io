<h2 id="series-introduction" data-numberify>Series Introduction<a class="anchor ms-1" href="#series-introduction"></a></h2>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re new to ARM/Bicep or a pro, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve run into the issue of needing conditional properties.  Unfortunately, ARM and Bicep do not officially have functions built in to handle this natively.  At least not as of yet.  I was surprised when writing this, to not see a whole lot of articles showing how work around this.</p>
<p>In this series, I&rsquo;m going to show you a few ways you can work a round this.  All of them are convoluted, but they do work.  Each one will have pros and cons, and it will be up to you determine which one you like best.  Of course, you don&rsquo;t have to stick to one or other.  Like most things in technology, use what works best in your situation.</p>]]></description>

<p>As many know, I&rsquo;m a big fan of automation.  A lot of my blog posts have focused on leveraging PowerShell to do my bidding.  As my career has evolved, so have the tools I leverage.  In a cloud world, even scripting by itself can become to error prone and inconsistent.  Many have been leveraging IaC (Infrastructure as Code) to solve this problem.  I am one such person.  For years I&rsquo;ve had an on again / off again relationship with Azure ARM.  I&rsquo;ve always loved the idea of it, but the execution was tedious and cumbersome.  Fast forward to the last year with the release of Bicep, I&rsquo;ve come back to the idea of leveraging IaC more. Recently, I had an opportunity to deploy an entire multi-environment platform via IaC.  I can tell you, I&rsquo;ve not only deployed all infrastructure via Bicep, but continued to keep it up to date.  Meaning, not a simple one an done deployment.  Rather maintaining the lifecycle of the platform with IaC.</p>]]></description>
