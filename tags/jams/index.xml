      <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="introduction" data-numberify>Introduction:<a class="anchor ms-1" href="#introduction"></a></h1>
<p>I wrote a really quick review <a href="http://wp.me/p62gzE-1W" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here<i class="fas fa-external-link-square-alt ms-1"></i></a> about MVP systems JAMS product about 1 year or so ago (maybe a little less). At the time, I was in search of a solution that could help me glue together several disjointed systems in a workflow. Specifically, we were trying to integrate Veeam and CommVault backupâ€™s together. Veeam was of course doing the VM backupâ€™s, and CommVault was copying the Veeam files to tape. Weâ€™ve since moved on from Veeam, but JAMS has continued to be a vital part of our infrastructure.</p>]]></description>

<p>I hate dealing with tapes, pretty much every aspect of them. The tracking of them is a PITA, having to physically manage them is a PITA, dealing with tape library issues is a PITA, dealing with tape encryption is a PITA, running out of tapes is a PITA, dealing with legal hold for tapes is a PITA, and I could keep going on with the many ways that tape just sucks. What makes matters worse is when you have to deal with MORE tapes.</p>]]></description>

      <title>Problem Solving: Chasing SQL&#39;s Dump</title>

      <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="the-problem" data-numberify>The Problem:<a class="anchor ms-1" href="#the-problem"></a></h1>
<p>For years as an admin Iâ€™ve had to deal with SQL. At a former employer, our SQL environment / databases were small, and backup licensing was based on agents, not capacity. Fast forward to my current employer, we have a fairly decent sized SQL environment (60 â€“ 70 servers), our backupâ€™s are large , licensing is based on capacity, and we have a full time DBA crew that manage their own backup schedules, and prefer that backupâ€™s are managed by them. What that means is dealing with a ton of dumps. Read into that as you want ðŸ™‚</p>]]></description>
