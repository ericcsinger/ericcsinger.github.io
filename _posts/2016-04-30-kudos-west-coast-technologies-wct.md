In general I have to say I’m not a fan of VAR’s for many reasons. Most of which because I find little “Value Add” in having them resell technology that would probably be cheaper if I wasn’t stuck going through them. However, there’s always an exception to the rule, and after a recent mess up I wanted throw a shout out to [WCT](http://wct.com/) for helping us out of a tough bind.

We ordered a new Quantum QXS (DotHill) SAN for some new backup storage. There was supposed to be some SPF’s in there for networking, but we could’t find anything. Its possible it got thrown out in all the excitement, or perhaps it never was put in the box. Can’t say for sure. What I can say is when I called WCT (Dave Holloway to be specific) about the issue, he took care of it right away. While working out the minutiae on the backend, they shipped us SFP’s out of their stock so we could get moving.

Now I’m not saying there aren’t any other VAR’s out there with this level of service, but I didn’t cringe making the call to WCT because I know they’re real people and get that shit happens.

Anyway, this is just a public kudos to them, to basically say “I really appreciate what you did”.
