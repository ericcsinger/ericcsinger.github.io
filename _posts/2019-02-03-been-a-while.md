Sorry it’s been so long since I’ve wrote anything. I’ve been busy with life and working on a new Powershell module. I’m hoping to get back into the groove soon. I’ve been working on a few things at work that might be interesting to write about.

For now, I’ll leave you with this. I’ve released my 1.0.0 version of my WSUS Powershell module. I’m not considering it “officially” released until I can start writing the wiki on how to use the module, but it is on the Powershell gallery and it is on my Github.

Here is the Github link: https://github.com/ericcsinger/ecs.wsus
