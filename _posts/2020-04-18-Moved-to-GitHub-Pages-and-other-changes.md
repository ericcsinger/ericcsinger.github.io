# Moved to GitHub pages

Sorry for the abrupt change for anyone out there following my blog.  I forgot about my hosting contract expiring with BlueHost. Not wanting to shell out for another year on their platform.  I accelerated my migration to GitHub Pages.

I wanted my content to be in a portable format, the best one being markdown.  I also didn't want the hassle of maintaining a full on custom website, so GitHub Pages is great solution for me.  

In rush of course, I don't have a solution for comments yet.  I see value in comments, so I will look to integrate Disqus.

I do have all my old content, so if you had something you used to reference once in a while, it's in my blog roll still.  

# What else is changing?

## Platforms

I've always wanted to have a YouTube channel for my content.  Some things are better communicated in a visual way.  As I get setup, some of my content may end up there.

## Career change

With that out of the way, there have been a few changes in my life.  For starters, I now work at the Project Management Institute. In my new role, I am focusing on being an "Operations Engineer".  Titles aside, the summary is, I'm full time in the weeds again.  

My role will focus on a few areas.
- **[Automation]:**  While I'm always focused on automation, I get to practice it a lot more.  With this focus, comes a lot more toys.  They include the following.
  - Azure DevOps
  - Azure Automation
  - Azure LogicApps  
- **[Active Directory]:** PMI has a global distributed AD, and we're  integrated into Azure.  I'll have plenty of opportunity to hone AD, GPO, Replication, and of course Azure AD hybrid services.
- **[Backup / Recovery / Storage]:** I will continue my journey in the backup recovery area.  More focused on working in a cloud centric environment.  Some of the tools we're using here include. 
  - Azure Recovery Vaults
  - Rubrik
  - Pure Storage
  - Azure Storage 

While I have a background in a lot of other technologies, some of them unfortunately may start to fade off.  I work in a larger team, so being a jack of all trades will be less of a need where I am.  That's not to say that I won't be working with other technologies, but it may not be as intense as it once was.

## Personal changes

I've wondered if there might be some value for me, and others if I started blogging about personal areas.  Things such as motorcycles, ATV's, cooking, working out, etc.

## Final notes

Please be patient with me as I continue to get my blog setup.  You may see some weirdness at times.  Hope to have some great content for you soon.
