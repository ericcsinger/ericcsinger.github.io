This is the first release of what I hope to be more Powershell modules. As mentioned in my earlier posts, I won’t go into details of the module in my posts, instead I’ll direct you to my GitHub page where you can read about the modules, it’s functions and release notes.

Functions released in this module:

- Convert ECSSIDToAccount
- Convert ECSAccountToSID

You can learn more about the module [here](https://github.com/ericcsinger/ECS.WindowsGeneric/wiki).
