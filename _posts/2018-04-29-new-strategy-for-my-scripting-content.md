I know I haven’t been posting a lot, but that’s because I’ve been busy developing my first public Powershell modules. This short post isn’t to discuss the specifics of that, but rather my new strategy going forward.

Many of you probably know what GitHub is by now, but for those of you who don’t, it’s pretty much the most popular version control system for code. While I’m not a developer per se, I do have a lot of Powershell stuff I write, and I wanted to start getting more formal with how I organize and manage it.

In the past, I would store my code in GitHub, but ultimately write about all the details here. Going forward, my blog will simply be used to announce the new release of a Powershell module, and I’ll send you to my GitHub page to see all the examples, and other related information. I figured it would be better to have everything related to the script code stored together. The how-to’s and release notes will be stored as GitHub wiki’s.

I still plan to do all my normal blogging, and if I’m running simple one off commands or whatnot, that will all still be published here.

Additionally, I’m going to be migrating most of my other existing Powershell functions into formal modules.
