This is a simple query you can use map your computers to their various targets in a nice easy to export table. Iâ€™d love to say the script is sexier than that, but its really not. You can find the sql query [here](https://github.com/ericcsinger/SQL/blob/master/Microsoft/Windows%20System%20Update%20Services%20(WSUS)/Computer%20to%20Computer%20Target/Computers%20to%20Computer%20Target.SQL).

There is only one section worth mentioning because it can change the way a computer is mapped to a computer target.

By default, my query returns the computer target location based on the child object. If you were to change that value from a 1 to a 0, it would show you the computers parent computer target instead. May or may not be of interest to you.
